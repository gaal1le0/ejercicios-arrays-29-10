Create a function that sorts the array sequence from smallest to largest.
Create a function that sorts the array sequence from highest to lowest.
Create a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of the data in the Sequence array.
The calculation of the letter of the National Identity Card (DNI) is a simple mathematical process based on obtaining the remainder of the integer division of the DNI number and the number 23. From the remainder of the division, the letter is obtained by selecting it from an array of letters. The array of letters is: Therefore if the remainder of the division is 0, the letter of the DNI is T and if the remainder is 3 the letter is A. With this data, elaborate a small script that:- Stores in a variable the number of DNI indicated by the user and in another variable the letter of the DNI that has been indicated. First check if the number is less than 0 or greater than 99999999. If this is the case, a message is displayed to the user indicating that the number provided is not valid and the program does not display any more messages. If the number is valid, the corresponding letter is calculated according to the method explained above. Once the letter has been calculated, it must be compared with the letter indicated by the user. If they do not match, a message is displayed to the user telling him/her that the letter he/she has indicated is not correct. Otherwise, a message is displayed indicating that the ID number and letter are correct. To do with high-level functions.
